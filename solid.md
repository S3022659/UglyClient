# SOLID Principle Violations in the Environment Simulation Code
The failings in the current code directly violate all five SOLID principles:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Violation: "All functionality is contained in a single Program class"

The Program class handles UI, business logic, API communication, error handling, and device control. This violates SRP which states a class should have only one reason to change.

Examples:

The Program class handles menu display, user input parsing, API calls, temperature control algorithms, and error reporting.
Methods like GetSensorTemperature, SetFanState, and DisplayAllSensorTemperatures all reside in the same class despite serving different purposes.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Violation: "No interface abstractions" and "Heavy use of static methods"

The code is not open for extension but closed for modification. Adding new device types or control mechanisms requires modifying existing code.

Examples:

Adding a new device type would require modifying the existing hardcoded device handling code.
Temperature control algorithms are hardcoded and can't be extended or replaced without modifying the original code.
Menu options are implemented in a switch statement that must be modified to add new functionality.
## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Violation: "Inconsistent data type handling for temperatures"

The application doesn't use inheritance and polymorphism properly, making it impossible to substitute derived classes.

Examples:

No proper type hierarchy for devices (sensors, fans, heaters).
Different return types for sensor readings (string, int, decimal) without proper abstraction.
No ability to use different implementations of device controls interchangeably.
## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Violation: "No clear object-oriented design" and "Only one DTO class (FanDTO)"

The code has few interfaces, and the existing IEnvironmentService interface contains methods that different clients might not need together.

Examples:

The IEnvironmentService interface combines unrelated responsibilities like temperature reading and fan/heater control.
Clients that only need to read temperatures still depend on the methods for controlling fans and heaters.
No separate interfaces for different device types with their specific operations.
## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Violation: "Direct dependencies" and "Direct HttpClient usage throughout the code"

High-level modules depend directly on low-level modules, rather than abstractions.

Examples:

The code directly depends on HttpClient rather than an abstraction like IEnvironmentApi.
Methods receive concrete HttpClient instances rather than interfaces.
Business logic directly performs HTTP calls instead of working with abstractions.
No dependency injection is used to provide implementations at runtime.
How Each Failing Maps to SOLID Violations
Failing	SOLID Principle Violated
Poor Separation of Concerns	SRP
Code Duplication	DRY (not SOLID but relevant)
Inconsistent Error Handling	SRP
Hard-coded Values	OCP
Poor API Communication Design	DIP
Lack of Models/DTOs	LSP, ISP
No Configuration Management	SRP
Poor Testability	DIP
Addressing These Issues with Patterns
The patterns you've identified align well with addressing SOLID violations:

Factory Pattern (for HTTP client) - Helps with DIP by creating abstractions
Facade Pattern (for API) - Addresses SRP by providing a simplified interface
Adapter Pattern (for sensors) - Helps with LSP by making incompatible interfaces work together
State Pattern (for controls) - Supports OCP by allowing new states without changing existing code
Command Pattern (for user input) - Improves SRP by separating UI from business logic
Implementing these patterns would significantly improve adherence to SOLID principles and make the code more maintainable, testable, and extensible.
